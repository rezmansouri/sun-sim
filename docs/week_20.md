# 1. `n_modes`

## 1.1. Shannon Nyquist Sampling Theorem

<i>A function containing no frequency higher than $$\omega$$ Hz, is completely determened by sampling it at $$2\omega$$ Hz.</i>

<i>i.e., to resolve all frequencies in a function, it must be sampled at twice the frequency present.</i>

Example: humans hear up to 22 KHz. `.mp3` files are 44 KHz.

In our case:

- latitude = 111
- longitude = 128
