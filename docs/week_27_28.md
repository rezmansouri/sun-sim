### Methods

#### Cross-validation:

- for finding # Layers and # Channels
- MSE as the metric

#### Other metrics

- ACC, PSNR, MS-SSIM, Earth Mover's

### Results

- 8 x 256 is the best
  - box and whisker plot for cross validation folds ✅
- SFNO is more accurate in high-speed areas (near poles)
  - Easiest case and hard case plots ✅
  - Ask pete why is HUX bad in polar regions❓
- Based on MSE, SFNO is more accurate in high gradient areas
  - box and whisker plot for all the instances ✅
  - Still, due to its ability to capture high-speed areas
- Based on MSE, the error increases as the radius becomes larger in both
  - Scatter plots ✅
- Based on Masked MSE, as the radius becomes larger SFNO has matching variance with HUX
  - Scatter plots ✅
- Based on visual inspection, HUX's estimates are still agreeing more with the MAS
  - MSE, ACC, PSNR, MS-SSIM and Earth Mover's results tell us the opposite or show almost no difference
  - A table ✅
  - Better metrics are required
