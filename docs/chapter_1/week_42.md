title: NSF - Cybersec Inf. Elements Proposal
---

1. Transformation from spatial/spatiotemporal to spectral/spectotemporal and back to spatial/spatiotemporal
    - Fourier transform (Visualize the difference on MAS)
    - Spherical harmonics transform (Visualize the difference on MAS)
    - More??
    - Resolution invariance of this approach (Visualize SFNO's)

2. More FNO versions to be cited

3. Table for time/resource consumption between HUX, SFNO (and MAS?) for $$v_r$$

4. Temporal pattern of errors for carrington rotations
