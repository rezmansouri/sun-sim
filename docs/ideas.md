1. GAN's discriminator as a metric?
2. Train an auto-encoder, detach the encoder, get feature vectors and do cosine distance?
3. Skip connections for SFNO?
4. feed the model slice 0 of the current CR and the last slice of the previous CR (interpolation problem?)
5. multihead model (global and local)
6. correct positional encoding for input? (the assumption is equiangular)
