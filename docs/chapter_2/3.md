Motivated by the Mori–Zwanzig formalism, MemNO augments a standard neural operator (e.g., FNO) with a sequence model that retains compressed information from past states, mitigating error accumulation and information loss. This is particularly relevant to our surrogate modeling of solar wind and CME propagation, where coarse inner-boundary observations and multiscale dynamics can render purely Markovian operator rollouts unstable or inaccurate over long horizons.
